            <h1> About Me </h1> 
            
            <p> 
                Living an active sport-filled life is important to me. I've always thrived in a team environment playing basketball for Connacht and Galway in secondary school. Today my hobbies are running, tag rugby, and hockey. So much of who I am as a professional comes from what I learnt through sports and being part of a team. I see this most when motivating a team during a particularly stressful project as the deadline approaches, highlighting what is going well but more importantly where we as a team can improve to achieve our collective goal. <br> 
            
            </p> 
            
            <h1>How I Work</h1> 
            
            <p> 
            
                I work best in a team environment but only when the work that I am doing directly impacts the team in a positive way. The work that I do has to matter to the team, administrative tasks do not excite me. I like to lead the team, lead the conversation, I have many ideas on how to improve a process and like to brainstorm with others on how to make sure the process works for everyone. I don't like it when my ideas are not considered or fall on deaf ears.  
            
                <br><br> 
            
                I am goal driven, competitive, and want to tackle issues as they arise head on. I like bullet points on the issues and don't like when information is dragged out. I constantly strive to improve myself - I realize my areas of weakness and try to improve upon them. This is most visible through all the additional learning courses that I have completed. <br> 
            
                1. BSC Microbiology <br> 
            
                2. MSc Biotechnology <br>

                4. Certification Agile <br> 
            
                5. Certification Agile Scrum Master <br>

                7. Higher Diploma in Computer Science and Data Analytics <br><br> 
            
                I plan to complete a communication course in January 2022 and am researching if it is feasible to complete a cloud-based training to advance my technical knowledge. <br><br>
